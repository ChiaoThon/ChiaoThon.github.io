A paper entitled [*CHEETAH: An Ultra-Fast, Approximation-Free, and Privacy-Preserved Neural Network Framework based on Joint Obscure Linear and Nonlinear Computations*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05184.pdf) is available on arxiv. This paper is about the way to accelerate the inference calculation with privacy concerns in Machine Leaning as a Service (MLaaS). The basic idea is to combine the calculation of linear and non-linear functions in neural network, which ignores the traditional propagation from exact linear result to non-linear function. We show that this joint computation for linear and non-linear functions largely improves the efficiency for privacy-preserved MLaaS.
